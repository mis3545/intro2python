When you remove the first letter, the remaining letters form a homophone of the original word, that is a word that sounds exactly the same. Replace the first letter, that is, put it back and remove the second letter and the result is yet another homophone of the original word. And the question is, what’s the word?\n",

It must have been a nine-pointer!’ It’s a perfect homophone. If you put the ‘w’ back, and remove the ‘r,’ instead, you’re left with the word, ‘wack,’ which is a real word, it’s just not a homophone of the other two words.\n",
    "\n",
    "        But there is, however, at least one word that Dan and we know of, which will yield two homophones if you remove either of the first two letters to make two, new four-letter words. The question is, what’s the word? \n",

    "You can use the dictionary from Question 1 to check whether a string is in the word list.\n",

    "To check whether two words are homophones, you can use the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary. You can download it from http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict or use the file <code>'c06d'</code> in folder <code>cartalk_homophone</code> and you can also use <code>pronounce.py</code>, which provides a function named <code>read_dictionary</code> that reads the pronouncing dictionary and returns a Python dictionary that maps from each word to a string that describes its primary pronunciation.\n",
